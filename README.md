This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Space-Age is a game I created out of curiosity for Tauri & Rust. It was more of practice than anything, but it became kind of a passion project that I plan on finishing in the future. I have submitted it to Solana Grizzlython this past March, and I have plans to submit atleast an 0.0 version of space-age to a few hackthons in 2023.
